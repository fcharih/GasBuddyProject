Today, I am essentially re-recruiting workers for the HIT, because too few
of them actually responded to my email.

I relaunched a HIT with 20 assignments ($2) in order to identify workers who
correctly complete the task. To qualify, one must have >90% approval rate and
submitted at least 200 assignments.

The HIT ID is 372AGES0I34CS4UBOACUXAN3JYKXRY.

Launched the HIT at around 8:50 AM.
